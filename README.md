The second part of this project analyzes the Requirements of certain Commodity or Commodity-Backed Monetary Systems, specifically, the legal monetary framework of former Ottoman Empire Territories- which currently make up a majority of the 57 nation-block (OIC).

### Usage

The Calculator app is developed as the first phase in understanding  interdependencies between currencies used to manufacture U.S. coins (see Coin-Catalog), the annual production of commoditees used in such coins, world GDP, and World Population. 


The tool is based on the follow:

>##### A list of U.S. coins currently used as legal tender.[Link](https://github.com/fintech3109/FinTech_Project_1/blob/3b869c590190c706bb57056d2c9d2ffd2ac498f7/UBI_PROJECT/Coins/coin_list/Coin-Catalog%20%20.pdf)
- Percentage Breakdown of the metals used to mint both historical and existing U.S. coins.
>##### Metal Api- Current prices of metals/ commodities used to manufacture coins. [List](./UBI_PROJECT/api/metals/API.ipynb)
>##### Seigneuriage Calculator or Melt Value vs Face Value [Link](./UBI_PROJECT/calculator.ipynb)
